Course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning 
- supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees),
- unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems)
- the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
