Machine Learning Specialization - this repository covers only course assignments

This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

3-course Specialization: 
- [x] Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification 
- [x] Advanced Learning Algorithms
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning - ongoing

Course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning 
- supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees),
- unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems)
- the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
